# Restaurants Reviews

This is a project developed by DevS for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree's Project

## Specification

The students have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all.

## Requirments

* **Make the provided site fully responsive & accessible.**

* **Cache the static project site for offline use.** Use Cache API and ServiceWorker, cache the data of the website so it can be accessible offline.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository;

2. From inside the new directory, launch a local client server using Python from your terminal:

If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`.

Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)

or

Python 3: python -m http.server 8000

3. Visit the site in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.
